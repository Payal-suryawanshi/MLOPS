Advanced Model Deployment and Integration using TFX Pipeline and Vertex AI

Objective: Enhance the scalability, consistency, and operational eTciency of machine learning models by leveraging TFX Pipeline and
Google Cloud's Vertex AI.
• Implemented Tensorqow Extended Pipeline : Ensured consistent data preprocessing, validation, and orchestration across training and
serving phases, signiCcantly reducing discrepancies known as Ftraining-serving skewF.
• Integrated Model Serving with 'ensorVlow Prototypes: Prepared and formatted features to align with the modelAs expectations during
training, improving prediction reliability.
• Deployed on Vertex AI : Xtilized Google qloudAs Oertex (I for scalable, robust management and real-time model serving capabilities. qreated
a callable library that can be integrated into production environments for instant predictions.
• Model qustomization: Developed a customizable and adaptable deployment strategy allowing end-users to modify the model based on their
speciCc operational needs, maintaining relevance in a dynamic business landscape.
